## scratch-vm
#### Scratch VM is a library for representing, running, and maintaining the state of computer programs written using [Scratch Blocks](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-blocks).

## Installation
If you build own application:
```bash
npm install https://github.com/LLK/scratch-vm.git
```
If you want to edit/play yourself:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:LLK/scratch-vm.git
cd scratch-vm
npm install
```

## Setup
For an extended setup example, check out the /playground directory, which includes a fully running VM instance.
```js
var VirtualMachine = require('scratch-vm');
var vm = new VirtualMachine();

// Block events
workspace.addChangeListener(vm.blockListener);
var flyoutWorkspace = workspace.toolbox_.flyout_.workspace_;
flyoutWorkspace.addChangeListener(vm.flyoutBlockListener);

// Run threads
vm.runtime.start();
```
## Development Server and Playground
For convenience, we've included a development server with the VM. This is useful because the VM can take advantage of executing in a WebWorker, which is not permitted in a local file. To start the server, run:

```bash
make serve
```
and go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) - you will be redirected to the playground, which demonstrates various tools and internal state.

## Standalone Build
```bash
make build
```

```html
<script src="/path/to/vm.js"></script>
<script>
    var vm = new window.VirtualMachine();
    // do things
</script>
```

## Abstract Syntax Tree

#### Overview
The Virtual Machine constructs and maintains the state of an [Abstract Syntax Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) (AST) by listening to events emitted by the [scratch-blocks](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-blocks) workspace via the `blockListener`. At any time, the current state of the AST can be viewed by inspecting the `vm.runtime.blocks` object.

        }
      },
      "next": null,
      "topLevel": false
    }
  }
```
